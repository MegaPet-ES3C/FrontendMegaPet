She lived on the street and took refuge from time to time in a cardboard box, her body was marked by abandonment, suffering and indifference.\nShe suffered from distemper, parasites, scabies, malnutrition and other diseases, it is very sad to see such a depressing state of an animal that she is not to blame for anything. During the first year Samy she was in a very bad state, she was not sure if she could be saved.\n\nAfter a while, Samy began to improve markedly, and the positive results of the intensive care she underwent began to be seen. Today Samy is super happy in her new home.",
